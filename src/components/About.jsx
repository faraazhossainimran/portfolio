In some layouts, you may need certain grid items to span specific amount of columns or rows instead of an even distribution. To achieve this, you need to pass the colSpan prop to the GridItem component to span across columns and also pass the rowSpan component to span across rows. You also need to specify the templateColumns and templateRows.Grid: The main wrapper with display: grid.
GridItem: Used as a child of Grid to control the span, and start positions within the grid.
Template columns#
Here's an example of using grid template columns with the grid component, and applying a gap or space between the grid items.</Text> */}
